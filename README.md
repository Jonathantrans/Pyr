Welcome to Jonathan Trans's Minecraft Pyr Resource Pack. \
We are excited to see you here! ðŸ˜Š 

PYR is a resource/texture pack add-on for Minecraft and is one of my first "serious" endeavors, created in early 2016. While undoubtedly a passion project, this taught me many practical lessons while developing it. I had to look at Minecraft's source code to find out how to utilize certain lightmaps for sky textures and lighting angles from objects such as torches, the sun, and the moon, one of my first experiences in building from an existing codebase and designing textures from scratch. As one of my first projects to gain public traction, I had to respond to user feedback and deal with bug reports, giving me a taste of maintaining a project. I couldn't have done this without my fans supporting me throughout my years on YouTube, receiving 600,000+ views total. 

PYR is hosted on MediaFire, where it currently has over 150,000 downloads. \
Tools: Java Developer Kit, Forge, and Paint.NET ðŸ‘»
